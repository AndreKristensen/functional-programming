// first-class functions â€” a programming language is said to have first-class functions when functions can be treated as any other data. 
// In C# first-class functions are supported using anonymous methods and lambdas. 
// Delegates

// Higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, 
// or returns a function, or both. We are used to passing as function parameters simple objects 
// like integers or strings, or more complex objects like collections and custom types. 
// But C# also has good support for HOFs.  This is done using delegates and lambda expressions.
