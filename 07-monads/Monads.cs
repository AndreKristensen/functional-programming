// In functional programming, a monad is a design pattern or a mathematical 
// concept that provides a way to structure computations and handle side effects in a 
// purely functional and composable manner. Monads are commonly used to address issues 
// related to impurity, such as I/O operations, state management, and exceptions, while 
// maintaining the principles of functional programming, such as immutability and referential transparency.
