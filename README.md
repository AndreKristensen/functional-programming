# Functional Programming in C#
This project demonstrates the use of functional programming in C#. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, which are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output for a given input. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in variables.

# Funcs Class
The Funcs class contains pure functions for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions take two input values and return a single output value, without modifying any external state or variables.

# PasswordExamples Class
The PasswordExamples class contains pure functions for validating passwords. These functions take a password string as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the password meets certain criteria, such as containing at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, at least one digit, and at least one special character. These functions do not modify any external state or variables, and always return the same output for a given input.

# Testing
The project includes unit tests for the Funcs and PasswordExamples classes using the NUnit testing framework. The tests demonstrate how to test pure functions in a functional programming paradigm, by arranging the input values, calling the function, and asserting that the output is what we expect it to be.

# Conclusion
Overall, functional programming promotes code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain, by minimizing side effects and mutable state. The Funcs and PasswordExamples classes in this project demonstrate how to use functional programming concepts in C# to write pure functions that are easy to test and maintain.
